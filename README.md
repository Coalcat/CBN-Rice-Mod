Add croppable rice called Indica Massachusettstica, which is fictional plant that can be grown in climates of New England.

includes rice grain, simple recipes for make dried rice and rice seed. 
I made it because no one made it and I'm the rice addicted Asian.

No additional stuff will be added in future, because I ONLY WANT TO CROP THOSE RICE IN MY RICEFIELD
